# Apex Websocket Lib

This is the Salesforce Apex library that is aimed to provide support for the websocket protocol. Which can be used directly from Apex runtime (not only via LWC js).

Of course the is no native support for websocket in Apex yet. This project uses external server which redirects http requests as a websocket message.

The source code of the server can also be found here.
